# Sigmoid-Regularization-Experimental-Framework
experimental framework to demonstrate the effectiveness of sigmoid regularization with structural pruning. The framework compares sigmoid regularization against traditional pruning methods and Liquid Time-Constant (LTC) networks across multiple datasets and network architectures.
